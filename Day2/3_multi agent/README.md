# Multi-Agent Architectures

## What is Multi-Agent Architecture?

Multi-agent systems break down complex tasks into smaller, specialized agents that work together. Instead of one agent trying to do everything, multiple agents collaborate, each focusing on their expertise area.

## Why Use Multi-Agent Systems?

- **Specialization**: Each agent becomes expert in one domain
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents for new capabilities
- **Reliability**: If one agent fails, others continue working
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing and better resource utilization

## Two Main Architectures

### 1. Supervisor Architecture (Centralized Control)

A central supervisor agent coordinates all other agents, making decisions about:
- Which agent to call next
- What data to pass between agents
- When to stop or continue the workflow

**How it works:**
```
User → Supervisor → Agent 1 → Supervisor → Agent 2 → Supervisor → Final Result
```

**Best for:**
- Sequential workflows
- Complex decision trees
- Quality control requirements
- Structured business processes

### 2. Swarm Architecture (Decentralized Control)

Agents dynamically pass control to each other based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active.

**How it works:**
```
User → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 1 → Final Result
```

**Best for:**
- Creative tasks
- Research workflows
- Iterative processes
- Collaborative problem-solving

## What We Built: Stock Recommendation System

### Architecture: Supervisor-based
We created a **4-agent stock analysis system** for Indian NSE markets:

1. **Stock Finder Agent** - Identifies promising stocks
2. **Market Data Agent** - Gathers technical indicators
3. **News Analyst Agent** - Analyzes recent news sentiment
4. **Price Recommender Agent** - Provides buy/sell advice

### How It Works:
```
User Query → Supervisor → Stock Finder → Market Data → News Analysis → Price Recommendation → Final Result
```

### Key Benefits:
- **Specialized Analysis**: Each agent focuses on one aspect
- **Sequential Processing**: Information builds up systematically
- **Quality Control**: Supervisor ensures complete workflow
- **Real-time Data**: Uses Bright Data for live market information

## Implementation Details

### Required Dependencies:
   ```bash
pip install langgraph-supervisor langchain-mcp-adapters
```

### Key Components:
- **Supervisor**: `create_supervisor()` from langgraph-supervisor
- **Agents**: `create_react_agent()` for each specialized agent
- **Tools**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) for external data access
- **Streaming**: Real-time output with `supervisor.stream()`

### Agent Communication:
- **Handoffs**: Supervisor passes control between agents
- **Data Flow**: Each agent receives output from previous agent
- **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history maintained

## When to Use Each Architecture

### Choose Supervisor When:
- You need strict control over workflow
- Tasks must happen in specific order
- Quality gates are required
- Business rules must be enforced

### Choose Swarm When:
- Agents can work independently
- Creative collaboration is needed
- Iterative improvement is desired
- Dynamic task routing is preferred

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Agent Roles**: Each agent should have one specific responsibility
2. **Efficient Communication**: Minimize data passed between agents
3. **Error Handling**: Plan for agent failures and recovery
4. **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and workflow completion
5. **Testing**: Test each agent individually and as a system

## Next Steps

- Test the current stock recommendation system
- Experiment with different agent prompts
- Add error handling and monitoring
- Try building a swarm architecture example
- Explore other multi-agent use cases

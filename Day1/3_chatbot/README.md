# Chatbot Implementation

## What is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is an AI application that can have conversations with users. It processes user input and generates appropriate responses, often maintaining conversation context.

## Why Build Chatbots?

- **User interaction** - Natural way for users to interact with AI
- **24/7 availability** - Always ready to help
- **Scalability** - Can handle multiple users simultaneously
- **Customization** - Can have different personalities and behaviors

## Files

### simple_chatbot.py
Basic chatbot that maintains conversation history. Shows fundamental chat functionality.

### personality_chatbot.py
Advanced chatbot with multiple personalities. Demonstrates how to customize AI behavior.

## What Each File Shows

### simple_chatbot.py
```python
# Store conversation history
conversation = []

# Add user message to conversation
conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

# Get AI response with full context
response = model.invoke(conversation)
```
**Learning**: Basic conversation flow and history management

### personality_chatbot.py
```python
# Define different personalities
personalities = {
    "friendly": "You are a very friendly and helpful AI assistant...",
    "professional": "You are a professional and formal AI assistant...",
    "creative": "You are a creative and imaginative AI assistant...",
    "teacher": "You are a patient and educational AI assistant..."
}

# Set system message for personality
conversation = [{"role": "system", "content": personalities[current_personality]}]
```
**Learning**: How to customize AI behavior and personality

## Key Concepts

### 1. Conversation History
Store previous messages so AI can remember context.

### 2. System Messages
Instructions that tell AI how to behave (personality, role, etc.).

### 3. Message Roles
- **system**: Instructions for AI behavior
- **user**: What the user says
- **assistant**: What the AI responds

### 4. Context Management
AI uses conversation history to provide relevant responses.

## How to Run

1. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up `.env` file with GROQ_API_KEY
3. Run examples:
   - `python simple_chatbot.py`
   - `python personality_chatbot.py`

## Learning Progression

1. **Start with simple_chatbot.py** - Understand basic conversation flow
